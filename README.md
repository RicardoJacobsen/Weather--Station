  I developed the weather station program from scratch based on the requirements described in the assessment document delivered by my unit tutor. A vital requirement was to read a file .txt with information about other .csv files as a database. I had to deal with thousands of weather information. Some of this information was wind speed, solar radiation, temperature and other related info about weather.
  The data was recorded from 2010 to 2019, getting information about the weather every 10 minutes. Due to this, massive data was generated, and we were required to find an efficient way to load and manage these data. In order to solve this problem, I decided to implement a map in which the key is the date, and the BST holds the data from that particular date.
	It was also required to display a menu with optins to the user chose. Each menu option does one kind of calculation, for exemple, in menu option 5, the program ask the user a day, month  and year and display calculation done to find the highest solar radiation and its time. 
  Having the map and the BST working together, the system created was very efficient in loading and manage the data. When information about a piece of specific information was required, the system responded with calculations very quick.


To run this program, it is necessary to extract the data from the data.rar file in the same directory the program is.
